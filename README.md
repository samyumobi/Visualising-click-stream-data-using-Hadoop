# Visualising-click-stream-data-using-Hadoop

Click stream data is an information trail a user leaves behind while visiting a website. It is typically captured in semi-structured website log files. Hadoop makes it easier to analyze, visualize and ultimately change how visitors behave on the website. These website log files contain data elements such as a date and time stamp, the visitor’s IP address, the destination URLs of the pages visited, and a user ID that uniquely identifies the website visitor. We can answer business questions such as:
•	What is the most efficient path for a site visitor to research a product, and then buy it?
•	What products do visitors tend to buy together, and what are they most likely to buy in the future?
•	Where should I spend resources on fixing or enhancing the user experience on my website?
This project describes how to refine website click stream data using the Horton works Data Platform, and how to analyze and visualize this refined data using the Power View feature in Microsoft Excel 2013. We focus on the “path optimization” use case. Specifically: how can we improve our website to reduce bounce rates and improve conversion
